            <h3>A couple paragraphs about me:</h3>
            <p>Hi!! I'm Julia and I'm your resident Bay Area tech trash bro. Just kidding.
                But I did grow up primarily in Cupertino for more than half of my life 
                so I've undoubtedly been influenced by the ever-changing technology trends born 
                from the heart of the Silicon Valley and have used pretty much any consumer-facing tech product out there. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know if I'd call myself a code junkie (following my earlier reference to being a tech trash; I also think I'm just a professional copy-paster),
                but I'm constantly learning more languages and tech stacks and challenging myself as well through the courses
                I take at UC Berkeley. In high school, I built and maintained websites for some of the clubs I was in
                and continued my passion for web design & dev in college, where I joined the course staff for a Web Design Decal
                at Berkeley. During breaks, such as winter or summer, I try to lose myself in a few personal projects as well, 
                as listed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also love travelling and vlogging (check out my Youtube channel!), exploring beautiful places
                and eating delish foods. I sometimes play video games in my free time and I also like urban dance. 
                If I'm not doing any of the above, you'll probably see me drinking boba milk tea and/or working out,
                but obviously not at the same time.
            </p>

            <h3>A list of projects I've worked on:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Kwizu</strong><br />
                    <i>React, React Native, Ruby on Rails, Heroku (old host), AWS (new)</i><br />
                    Kwizu is an app I started about 2 weeks ago that is based on an old app I created that used to 
                    be called "Kindred," but I am building the React Native mobile app as well as the server code from scratch.
                    If you've ever heard of Buzzfeed quizzes before, Kwizu is basically a better version of that where users
                    can take fun personality and trivia quizzes, store their responses, and compare their results with friends.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Dreamemo</strong><br />
                    <i>HTML, CSS, MEAN (JS), Ionic SDK, AWS</i><br />
                    This was the first ever iOS and mobile app that I ever published. I released the first version of the app 
                    on the App Store in high school and made just a few more iterations on it. I'm thinking of getting back to 
                    revisiting and updating it to a newer version once I've released Kwizu. Dreamemo is a mobile app that doubles as 
                    both a dream journal and personal motivation and meditation tool.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Verze</strong><br />
                    <i>HTML, CSS, MEAN (JS), Ionic SDK, AWS</i><br />
                    Shortly after I released Dreamemo, I poured my heart and soul into another mobile app, this time on a much 
                    bigger scale. After over a year or working on it in between schoolwork, I released it at the beginning of my senior year, 
                    and later also made a web version of it as well. Unfortunately, the code base is really hefty and hard to maintain, but in the future 
                    I definitely want to go back and revise it. Verze is a foreign language-learning app that relies on interactive, multi-sensory cards with 
                    fun exercises. Unlike other language apps, Verze focuses more on the user-creation side, where users can also help teach others languages 
                    by generating their own cards, decks, and courses.</p>
