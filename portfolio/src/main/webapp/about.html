                <h2>A couple paragraphs about me:</h2>
                <p>Hi!! I'm Julia and I'm your resident Bay Area tech trash bro. Just kidding.
                    But I did grow up primarily in Cupertino for more than half of my life 
                    so I've undoubtedly been influenced by the ever-changing technology trends born 
                    from the heart of the Silicon Valley and have used pretty much any consumer-facing tech product out there. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know if I'd call myself a code junkie (following my earlier reference to being a tech trash; I also think I'm just a professional copy-paster),
                    but I'm constantly learning more languages and tech stacks and challenging myself as well through the courses
                    I take at UC Berkeley. In high school, I built and maintained websites for some of the clubs I was in
                    and continued my passion for web design & dev in college, where I joined the course staff for a Web Design Decal
                    at Berkeley. During breaks, such as winter or summer, I try to lose myself in a few personal projects as well, 
                    as listed below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also love travelling and vlogging (check out my Youtube channel!), exploring beautiful places
                    and eating delish foods. I sometimes play video games in my free time and I also like urban dance. 
                    If I'm not doing any of the above, you'll probably see me drinking boba milk tea and/or working out,
                    but obviously not at the same time.
                </p>
