            <h2>A list of projects I've worked on:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Kwizu</strong><br />
                    <i>React, React Native, Ruby on Rails, Heroku (old host), AWS (new)</i><br />
                    Kwizu is an app I started about 2 weeks ago that is based on an old app I created that used to 
                    be called "Kindred," but I am building the React Native mobile app as well as the server code from scratch.
                    If you've ever heard of Buzzfeed quizzes before, Kwizu is basically a better version of that where users
                    can take fun personality and trivia quizzes, store their responses, and compare their results with friends.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Dreamemo</strong><br />
                    <i>HTML, CSS, MEAN (JS), Ionic SDK, AWS</i><br />
                    This was the first ever iOS and mobile app that I ever published. I released the first version of the app 
                    on the App Store in high school and made just a few more iterations on it. I'm thinking of getting back to 
                    revisiting and updating it to a newer version once I've released Kwizu. Dreamemo is a mobile app that doubles as 
                    both a dream journal and personal motivation and meditation tool.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Verze</strong><br />
                    <i>HTML, CSS, MEAN (JS), Ionic SDK, AWS</i><br />
                    Shortly after I released Dreamemo, I poured my heart and soul into another mobile app, this time on a much 
                    bigger scale. After over a year or working on it in between schoolwork, I released it at the beginning of my senior year, 
                    and later also made a web version of it as well. Unfortunately, the code base is really hefty and hard to maintain, but in the future 
                    I definitely want to go back and revise it. Verze is a foreign language-learning app that relies on interactive, multi-sensory cards with 
                    fun exercises. Unlike other language apps, Verze focuses more on the user-creation side, where users can also help teach others languages 
                    by generating their own cards, decks, and courses.</p>
